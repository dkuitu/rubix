Android 2x2 rubix cube app

This was a project for Mobile app developement class http://camosun.ca/learn/calendar/current/web/ics.html#ICS224

The app is a 2 dimensional 2x2 rubik's cube with six button to represent the possible moves. Each button triggers a function that swaps the background colours of each tile accordingly. As of now the "scramble" and "reset" buttons do not work because I ran out of time during the class. I hope to implement them when I find time.

The app can be imported to Android Studio and emulated by pressing 'ctrl' + 'R'
